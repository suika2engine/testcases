Automatic Testing Framework for Suika2
======================================

The test cases are recorded by `suika-capture`.
We replay them by `suika-replay` on Linux.

## `suika-capture`
`suika-capture.exe` is a tool that records all user operations.
As well as screenshot files, it creates a CSV file that contains all user interactions.

## `suika-replay`
`suika-replay` replays a CSV file that is generated by `suika-capture`.

## Our Testing Framework
A test case is created when a new feature is added.
We capture a log by `suika-capture` and save it as a new test case.

Each test case is executed by `suika-replay`.
We can detect bugs by the difference of the answer and the result screenshots.

When a commit is pushed to GitHub, automated testing is done by GitHub Actions.
Throughout this process, we can detect bugs immediately when they get into `Suika2`.

This is a very advanced technology in software testing field.
It is a testing technique called capture-and-replay.
Since spreadsheets are used to write test cases,
this could be included in a technique called keyword-driven testing.
It is difficult to find books in this area, so please search for papers.
